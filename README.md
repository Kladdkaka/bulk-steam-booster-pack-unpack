# bulk-steam-booster-pack-unpack

Hello!

This is a userscript I modified from some code I found at this pastebin http://pastebin.com/G2DD1eUN
Please don't be too mean about the terrible code, I didn't write it ya know ;)

Instructions:

1. Go into your inventory page
2. Click on the Steam Tab
3. Click on Community on the drop-down table thingy :P http://prntscr.com/cfphxr (Important! it wont work otherwise, don't ask me why O.o)
4. Click the unpack button!

Warning: This script doesn't have any wait timer or anything to prevent hammering the Steam servers with requests (I made this mistake of sending 280 requests in a second :c nothing happened though ^^)

If you have any questions, feel free to make a issue or add me on Steam.

Enjoy!
